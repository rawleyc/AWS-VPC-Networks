## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Amazon VPC?

Amazon VPC is a tool to manage the networks and resources within the cloud. It is useful because through it we can control which resource get to talk to which other resource, and also which resource can access the internet.

### How I used Amazon VPC in this project

I used Amazon VPC to create a VPC and also subnets in the VPC. I then created Internet Gateways to allow internet access and attached them to the VPCs.

### One thing I didn't expect in this project was...

I didn't expect the project to be simple and straight-foward, I thought it would be complicated.

### This project took me...

This project took me roughly an hour to complete.

## Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)

VPC are the solution to segmentaion of systems within the cloud... they allow us to seperate the public from private, and still somewhat maintain a connection in between the two.

There was already a default VPC in my account ever since my AWS account was created. This is because AWS creates that VPC by default in order to allow you to launch services such as EC2 instances that require a VPC to funtion.

To set up my VPC, I had to define an IPv4 CIDR block, which is the range of IP adresses that will be available to the resources in my VPC.

## Subnets

Subnets are mini-zones that exist inside my VPC. There are already subnets existing in my account, one for every availability zone.

Once I created my sunet I enable the option to automatically assign public adresses. This setting insures that upon resource creation like an EC2 instance in the VPC, it will get a public IP adress assigned to it so that it can connect to the internet.

There difference between public and private subnets are public subnets have an internet gateway attached that allows them to connect to the internet, while private subnets do not have any internet gateways. For a subnet to be considered public it must be accessible from the internet.

## Internet gateways

Internet gateways are the key to exposing private resources to the internet. They allow the resources with the VPC to access the internet and be accessible to external users.

Attaching an internet gateway to a VPC means that any resource in the VPC with a public IP address can now access the internet and is accessible to external users.

## Using the AWS CLI

VPC resources can also be created with CloudShell, which is a shell inside the AWS MAnagement Console that can be used to automate resource management with scripts. CLI is a software that lets you manage AWS resources with scripts instead of clicking around the AWS Management Console.

To set up a VPC or a subnet, you can use the command 'aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id [VPC ID] --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/26'.
MAke sure to avoice errors by including the hyphen in cidr-block

Compared to using the AWS Console, an advantage of using the commands is that they're faster. AN advantage of using the console is that it is easier to use for beginners. Overall I preferred the console.
